# RAG-AI (WIP - learning)

A compact Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) reference project for building question-answering and assistant systems that combine a vector-based retrieval layer with a generative model.

# Planning
- Create a simple TUI that can train on `knowledge.txt` and remember it, can be prompt
- Added a blog to further explain how RAG works
- Create a tutorial on how to run in README
- Show the history of the project on blog - was using langchain but there is error (langchain.chains = modulsnotfounderror)
